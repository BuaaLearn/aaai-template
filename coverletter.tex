\setlength{\parskip}{0.4em}
% PARAGRAPH ONE: State the reason for the letter, name the position or
 % type of work you are applying for and identify the source from which
 % you learned of the opening.\\ 

Please find enclosed my CV in application for the position of Research
 Intern (22260BR). Among the list of projects posted on ({\small
 researcher.watson.ibm.com / researcher / view\_group.php ? id=6504}), I
 found one project very interesting because it matches my
 specialization. The project is titled as ``Robust Activity Planning and
 Scheduling with Multi-Modal Travel''.

% PARAGRAPH TWO: Indicate why you are interested in the position, the
% company, its products, services - above all, stress what you can do
% for the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain how your
% academic background makes you a qualified candidate for the
% position. If you have practical work experience, point out specific
% achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat the same
% information the reader will find in the resume. The purpose of this
% section is to strengthen your resume by providing details which bring
% your experiences to life.\\ 

My list of publications shows that I am well prepared for this
position. I made my papers regularly accepted in the competitive
research conferences on Heuristic Search and Optimization. I worked on both the
application-oriented research and the fundamental research.

I am a fast, clean programmer who can write fast, maintainable and reliable programs.
I favor collaboration, code review and a good coding standard.
% is able to fully leverage the metaprogramming
% techniques which reduces the code size and make the program maintainable.
My open sourced projects are publicly hosted on github and proves these abilities.
% :
% 1) From the activity log, you can see the first prototypes of the most
%  complicated systems/projects are finished within 2 weeks.
% 2) Most of these projects are continuously tested through CI services
%  for reliability. I occasionally accept bug fixes, merged without breaking the code.
% 3) I regularly write concise documentation, using well-defined terms and ideas.
% 4) With an ability to fully leverage the metaprogramming, I can write even the most
%  complicated kinds of compile-time optimization within 500 lines of code.
I am excited about using my specialization for the real world, fast pased
development.

% Moreover, I am a fast learner. I wrote my first conference paper within 6 months after changing the
% major from Traffic Simulation to Heuristic Search (which I have no
% experience at that time), moving in to the different laboratory as a stranger.

% The nature of my degree course has prepared me for this position. It
% involved a great deal of independent research, requiring initiative,
% self-motivation and a wide range of skills. For one course, [insert
% course], an understanding of the [insert sector] industry was
% essential. I found this subject very stimulating.
% 
% I am a fast and accurate writer, with a keen eye for detail and I should
% be very grateful for the opportunity to progress to market reporting. I
% am able to take on the responsibility of this position immediately, and
% have the enthusiasm and determination to ensure that I make a success
% of it.

% PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and indicate your
 % flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the
 % letter. End the letter by thanking the employer for taking the time
 % to consider your credentials.\\ 

Thank you for the valuable time to consider this application. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.\\

Sincerely yours, \\
