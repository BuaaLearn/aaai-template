Sophisticated tiebreaking is a heuristic-agnostic improvement and thus 
falls into above category of techniques.

The attention to the search algorithm itself is relatively small since
most literature depends on bare \astar.  This was because variations of
best first search focus on different requirements, such as IDA* on
linear space, WA*/Lazy-A*/GBFS/EHC on trading speed for optimality, RWA*
on replanning, etc., and not on improving upon \astar itself.

maintaining all of its charactristics: memory-greedy yet efficient
optimal algorithm.
