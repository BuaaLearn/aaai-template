\emph{Globally-admissible heuristics} \cite{karpas2012optimal} are the class of heuristics that guarantee the optimality only on a certain optimal solution. These heuristics are then found to be a path-dependent heuristics. The interesting relation between our diversity-aware tie-breaking and this globally-admissible heuristics is that they both accounts for the path from the initial state to the current state. Further research on this direction will be an interesting avenue of  future work.
