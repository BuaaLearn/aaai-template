% Add this back in the camera-ready version


A possible interpretation of this approach 
% from the symbolic perspective
is that
this regularization is working as a model prior corresponding to \emph{closed-world assumption} \cite[CWA]{reiter1981closed},
which assumes that all propositions are false
when they are unknown to a Knowledge Base (KB) or cannot be proven from it.
% % [wrong!]
% % We could interpret these unknown propositions defaulted to be false as those which are irrelevant
% % to the current task that the agent is solving.
% Being always false, the agent can safely ignore them because
% they do not trigger an additional set of rules by satisfying their preconditions.
% Also, the KB no longer has to explicitly store the false propositions.
With CWA, KBs no longer have to explicitly store the false propositions,
just as the ZSAE can prune the constant-0 nodes.
% 
% Similarly, in ZSAE, we could conceive that there is an infinite number of neurons
% that are already pruned from the network and are just invisible.
