% to the motivation of the paper

Since the advent of delete-relaxation and abstraction heuristics in
admissible Classical Planning, much of the interest was focused on improving
the accuracy of these heuristic functions to prune more nodes from the
search space.
% 
However, recent work by Helmert and Roger
\shortcite{helmert2008good} claims that, even with an optimistic
assumption of \emph{almost-perfect heuristics}, \astar still has an
exponentially large plateau. They conclude that the further performance
improvement requires the techniques orthogonal to the heuristic
function, such as symmetry breaking, domain reduction, factored planning
etc.
