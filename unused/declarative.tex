\section{Declarative Knowledge Base based on ZSAE}

Since the ZSAE achieves a sparse encoding where the unused propositions
tend to become false, the network has a large amount of unused weights
which, if retrained properly, could be used for storing additional
information that is provided afterwards, making the entire network looks
like a declarative knowledge base where you can incrementally store
new knowledge.

We verify this hypothesis by first training a ZSAE with some dataset, retraining the same ZSAE with
a completely new dataset, then finally test the reconstruction accuracy for both dataset.
