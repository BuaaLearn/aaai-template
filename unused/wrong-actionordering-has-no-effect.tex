\subsubsection{Do Action Orderings Affect the Performance?}

Finally, we show that the performances of tie-breaking strategies are
not affected by the bias introduced in the action orderings in the PDDL
domain definition.
In \textbf{satisficing planning}, tie-breaking behavior
is known to be affected by the accidental bias in action ordering in the PDDL domain
definition \cite{vallati2015effective}.

We tested $[f,h,\lifo]$ and $[f,h,\fifo]$
on 3 individual sets of domains in which the
original names of action schema are uglyfied into random strings. This is because
the Fast Downward code base has a preprocessing
step which sorts the action schemas according to the dictionary
order, and it affects the order of the applicable actions of each search node.
% 
The coverage results are shown in \reftbl{actionordering-robustness}.
The result suggests that in cost-optimal planning, the effect of action
ordering has little effect on the performance.
\todo{maybe better to increase the number of runs.}
% We analysed these results using statistical methods.
% We first applied Bartlett test to test if the sample groups wrto each
% set of randomized domains share the same variance.
% There is no significant difference between the variances of the sample
% groups with confidence $p=0.00 < 0.05$.
% 
% Since the variances are the same, we applied one-way ANOVA to test if
% the sample groups have the same mean values.
% %%
% % Since the variances are not the same, we applied 
% % non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test to test if
% % the sample groups have the same mean values.
% This was verified with a confidence $p=0.00<0.05$.
