In the applications of automated planning such as Penetrating Testing,
Propositional Planners try to find an attack plan to take control over
the simulated corpolate network, mimicking the behavior of the real
attacker, until the network security is improved and no attack plan
exists \cite{boddy2005course}.  Here, maintaining the diversity of the
attack plans is an important demand by the customers because such
diversity provides a broader insight on the weakness of the corporation
network. To meet these demands, several diversity metrics were
developped \cite{roberts2014evaluating,goldman2015measuring} along with
several algorithms that returns a set of diverse plans
\cite{srivastava2007domain,coman2011generating,nguyen2012generating}.

Diversity, or more frequently referred to as the problem of
\emph{exploration} versus \emph{exploitation}, was also considered
beneficial in improving the search efficiency.  \emph{k-Best First
Search} \cite{felner2003kbfs} and \emph{Diverse Best First Search(DBFS)}
\cite{imai2011novel} were developed for improving the search behavior of
Greedy Best First Search by shifting the balance slightly from
exploitation to exploration, because GBFS is sometimes misdirected by
the errors in the heuristic estimates, and stays too narrowly focused on
the wrong direction.

In Robotics, RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) algorithm
\cite{lavalle2001randomized} is a \sota randomized algorithm for
high-dimensional, \emph{continuous} space and is widely known for its
provably good balance between exploration and exploitation. Unlike
\astar, this algorithm is not guided at all, i.e.\ it does not use any
heuristic functions, although there are various attempts to implement it
\cite{urmson2003approaches,urmson2003approaches}. Hence several papers
\cite{alcazar2011adapting,burfoot2006rrt,likhachev2008r} have tried to
merge RRT-based algorithms to \astar, which is designed for discrete
state spaces.
%  They wrapped a guided % search with randomized tree construction which allows the planner to search the state space scarcely, and its scarceness has a significant mathematically good characteristics such as uniform distribution and convergence.

Despite these interests, the role of diversity in \(A^*\)-based search
algorithms is underinvestigated.
KBFS, DBFS and GBFS are all inadmissible.
% RRT-based planners do not significantly improve upon the current
% state-of-the-art planner such as LAMA \cite{alcazar2011adapting}, although it
% has improved in some domains.
RRT-based planners are also subjective to the probabilistic convergence,
which means the optimality is guaranteed only when an infinite amount of
search time is provided, or they simply succumb to inadmissible search.
