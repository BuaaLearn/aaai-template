% perhaps we don't need this?

In order to test the significance of mean value,
we first applied Fligner-Killeen's non-parametric test to see if the sample groups 
in each set of randomized domains share the same variance.

% There is no significant difference between the variances of the sample
% groups with confidence $p=0.00 < 0.05$.

We could not reject the homogeneity of variances ($p=0.74$).

Since the variances are not significantly different,

we applied one-way ANOVA to test if
the sample groups have the same mean values.

+ The null hypothesis is that all of the variances are equal.
+ when $p$ is small, then the present distribution is highly unlikely if H0 is true.
+ when p is large, then the present distribution is highly likely if H0 is true.
