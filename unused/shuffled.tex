% Although above result suggests that the depth-based tiebreaking and
% third-level tiebreaking affects the performance,
One issue in the above analysis is that this difference might
be caused by the accidental bias in the action order in the
domain definitions.
Thus we also tested \emph{shuffled-zerocost} domains
in which we mechanically shuffled the action orderings in the
domain file. The results showed the same trends as in the original
zerocost domains. (Due to space constraint, we put this figure in the
supplementaly material.)
