\subsection{AMA$_1$, an Oracular Action Model Acquisition method}

Action Model Acquisition method AMA$_1$ produces a PDDL/SAS model compatible to
FastDownward \cite{Helmert04}, but is an oracular model which requires the entire state transitions
in the environment.
For each pair of observations $\parens{\before_i, \after_i}$ in the entire set of state transitions allowed in the environment,
AMA$_1$ uses SAE to encodes it into 
a symbolic transition $(Encode(\before_i),$ $Encode(\after_i))=$ $(s_i,t_i)$ where $s_i,t_i$ are propositional states.
Each state (either $s_i,t_i$) is represented as a binary vector $(b_j)_{1\leq j \leq N}$.
Each symbolic transition is then encoded into a PDDL action 
using $s_i$ as its preconditions and the difference of $s_i$ and $t_i$ as its effects.
Each bit $b_j$ is converted into zero-ary predicate \texttt{($b_j$-true)} and \texttt{($b_j$-false)}
when $b_j=1$ and $0$, respectively.
For instance, when $b_5$ is 0 in $s_i$ and 1 in $t_i$,
the preconditions include \texttt{(b5-false)} and
the effects include \texttt{(and (not (b5-false)) (b5-true))}.
