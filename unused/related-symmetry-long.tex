\emph{Symmetry Breaking} \cite{Fox1998,pochter2011exploiting,domshlak2013symmetry} is the search technique that tries to prune the symmetric states in the search space. Symmetric states are expected to have the same $f$ value and therefore increases the size of the plateau. Also, the number of symmetric states is equal to the number of permutation of variables, which grows exponentially to the number of variables and causes the memory exhaust. Notion of similarity and diversity generalizes the idea of symmetry, but since symmetry is more stricter than the similarity, our approach does not allow the states to be pruned completely, and instead just delay the expansion within the same f-value. Thus it does not decrease the worst case complexity, but in practice it performed very well, as evidenced in our experiments.
