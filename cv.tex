\section{Work Experience}

\begin{CV}

\item[12/2011--09/2012] Internship at Metamoji.inc.  Prototyped a
  drawing-chat system for iPad. Both the server and the client side are
  written in Javascript with Node.js and Titanium Mobile.

\item[04/2012--08/2012] Teaching Assistant in ``Field Work -
 Introductory Course on Automobiles'', under
 Project Professor Kohei Kusaka.
 % The students learn the mechanism and the engineering
 % design decision of vehicles through vehicle maintenance experience.
 % prepared the maintainance materials such as lubricant, sealing and
 % oil filters, moved the vehicle which will be used for maintainance, and
 Advised the students from a safety standpoint while they
 learn the mechanism of a vehicle through the maintenance.
 
\item[04/2013--08/2013] Teaching Assistant in ``Experiments in
 Information and Environmental Sciences'', under
 Assoc.\ Prof.\ Haruo Saito.
 % Students are required to
 % conduct a specific experiment each week. Experiments include reading
 % the data from the various sensors and importing it to a computer,
 % during which the students are required to make use of digital circuits.
 % Tasks also include measuring the output of comparators, invert
 % amplifiers and filters that must be built by the students.
 Assisted students assemble and calibrate analog or digital
 circuits to read the physical value of the
 experimental equipment.

\item[03/2014--09/2014] Internship at LogicVein.inc,
 % LogicVein is
 a developer of a Configuration Management System
 for network routers and switches.
 % , an award-winning software that allows the users to
 % efficently manage the complex network configurations of remote routers and switches.
 % Useful batch orders can be triggered by their intuitive graphical interface.
 Worked on % . The materials
 % consist of: advertisement leaflets, blog articles and
 the technical product manual (more than 200 pages long) %  The materials
 % contain both the Japanese and English documents. Some staff are
 % native English speakers born in United States, who checked and highly
 % evaluated the quality of the English translation.
 and converted it into

activities on Github}. Notable projects are:

(2015) \href{https://github.com/guicho271828/trivia}{trivia},
\href{https://github.com/guicho271828/trivia.balland2006}{trivia.balland2006}
: Trivia is an extensible pattern matching compiler in Common Lisp. It gained several stars on github.

(2012) macascript : (now obsolete) a homoiconic language that compiles
into javascript.

----

(2013--present) Managing Torque-based compute clusters in the laboratory. Maintaining
the NFS/NIS-based file sharing and login name synchronization. To
alleviate the power capacity limitation, I split the cluster into 2
locations and connected the LANs via secure VPN.

(2011--2012) Professional engineering activity on engine modification on
Mazda Miata '89-'04 under Project Professor Kohei Kusaka. Activities
include full engine rebuilding, mechanical engineering (I changed the
compression ratio by milling the engine header by 0.70mm using a large
face mill), fuel map / ignition timing optimization (with
Javascript-based visualizer \& hex-file editor), development of
variable resonance intake controller (Arduino).

(2011) Certification in ``basic course on machining technique'' by Prof. Ryu Chikayama.

(2005--2007) Development of Bipedal robot with embedded microcontroller
(Microchip\textregistered PIC and analog servo motors)


\section{Undergraduate Thesis Abstract}

{\small
In the literature of large-scale traffic simulation,
one of the major approaches is called a microscopic multiagent model.
It simulates the behavior of each car (an agent)
to produce the macroscopic emergent phenomena, e.g.\  traffic-jams,
% The accuracy of the model are validated through
% the comparison between the k-q (traffic density to average velocity)
% curves of simulated and actual environments.
% which can be heavily affected by the agent behavior.
therefore, developping the appropriate agent model is the key
factor to maintain the simulation accuracy.  One critical aspect of
agent behavior is called a cooperative behavior. We have implemented an agent
interaction model based on Spatiotemporal RRT(St-RRT) to
simulate the cooperative behavior and evaluated the
effectiveness of our approach.
}

\section{Masters Thesis Abstract}

{\small
In Automated Planning \& Scheduling (P\&S),
domains such as factory assembly requires the planner program to
assemble many identical instances of a particular product.  While modern classical
planners can generate assembly plans for single instances of a complex
product, generating plans to manufacture many instances of a product is
beyond the capabilities of standard planners. We proposed ACP, a system
which, given a model of a single instance of a product, automatically
reformulates and solves the problem as a cyclic planning problem.  We
showed that our ACP system can successfully generate
cyclic plans for problems which are too large to be solved directly
using standard planners.
