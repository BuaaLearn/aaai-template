% Recently, \latentplanner \cite{Asai2018} combined classical planning with deep-learning

While Classical Planning is an active branch of AI,
its applicability is limited to the tasks precisely modeled by humans.

% 
Meanwhile, \latentplanner \cite{Asai2018} uses a Neural Network (NN)
called State AutoEncoder (SAE) to obtain the propositional
representation of the image based puzzle domains with unsupervised learning,
then generates a propositional state space and performs Classical Planning,
partly resolving this bottleneck.

In this paper,
we define a new sub-problem of symbol grounding problem (SGP), the symbol \emph{stability} problem (SSP).
Informally, symbols are
\emph{stable} when they refer to the same concept for the exact same
observation of the environment, and unstable symbols are harmful for symbolic
reasoning.
We then address SSP in \latentplanner,
specifically the uninformative / random propositions in the latent / symbolic encoding.
We propose ``Zero-Suppressed SAE''
(ZSAE), an enhancement of SAE that uses the idea of closed-world
assumption as a prior for NN optimization 
and robustly generates a set of stable symbols.
% 
We empirically show that it finds more stable propositions
against various hyperparameters and improves the success rate of
\latentplanner.

\section{Introduction}

% [This second version of introduction is too long]

Symbol Grounding Problem (SGP) \cite{harnad1990symbol,Steels2008} is one of the key milestones in AI research
which seeks to achieve high-level intelligence.
% In Physical Symbol Systems Hypothesis \cite{newell1976computer}, it is believed that
% an agent with high-level intelligence performs tasks by efficiently manipulating a compact set of abstract symbols.
% 
% Symbolic manipulation
%  % consists of mechanical applications of composable rules which 
% allows for
% development of highly optimized and generalized, domain-independent heuristics (e.g. FF \cite{Hoffmann01} or LMcut \cite{Helmert2009})
% that can be easily applied to multiple tasks with few or no data,
% while the current learning-based approaches struggle to improve its multi-task performance and data efficiency.
% For example, training AlphaGo \cite{alphago} takes days on a huge cluster of custom-made Tensor Processing Units.
% % 
% To enable such a fully automated high-level symbolic computation in a real-world environment,
% agents should be able to find the symbolic representation of the environment by itself, i.e. solving the Symbol Grounding Problem.
% 
Recently, Latplan system \cite[\refig{fig:overview}]{Asai2018} successfully
connected a subsymbolic neural network system and a symbolic Classical Planning system
to solve various visually presented puzzle domains.
% In contrast to the work by Konidaris et. al. (\citeyear{KonidarisKL14}),
% Latplan is a straightforward NN built upon a \lsota framework.
The State AutoEncoder (SAE) neural network in \latentplanner
generates a set of propositional symbols from the training data consisting \emph{only of images},
i.e., by unsupervised learning without manual tagging,
and provides a bidirectional mapping between images and propositional states.
% 
The system then solves the propositional planning problem using a classical planner Fast Downward \cite{Helmert04}
and returns an image sequence that solves the puzzle
by decoding the intermediate propositional states of the plan.
It also discovers a set of action symbols that distinguish the modes of
state transitions through AMA$_2$ unsupervised learning process.
Therefore, the system solves SGP for two kinds of symbols:
Propositional symbols and action symbols.
% 
The system opens a promising direction for
applying a variety of symbolic methods to the real world, \emph{not just planning}:
In fact, the search space generated by \latentplanner was shown to be compatible
to an existing Goal Recognition system \cite{amado2018goal}.

Despite its success,
the propositional representations learned by Latplan have a problematic behavior
because NNs in general do not have a strong guarantee on the learned results.
The propositional symbols generated by Latplan are not always
``stable'', i.e., some propositions may not remain true or false given the identical image input
and rather flip randomly.
These \emph{unstable} propositions do not affect the output image decoded from the propositional state either.
Thus they are ``unused'' and ``uninformative'' at the same time.

Unstable symbols are harmful for symbolic reasoning because
they break the identity assumption built into the reasoning algorithms.
For instance, in \latentplanner, 
a single image may map to multiple propositional states due to stochasticity,
therefore the duplication detection in search algorithms such as \astar \cite{hart1968formal}
cannot detect that a single real-world state is visited multiple times through
different symbolic state representations.

This problem arises for any grounding processes applied to the real world.
The first contribution of this paper is the identification of a sub-problem of SGP
called ``symbol \emph{stability} problem'' (SSP), which seeks to find a set of symbols
whose values/referents are stable.
Stability is orthogonal to the \emph{performance} of the NNs:
NNs are known to perform robustly, but they do not guarantee
the quality of the internal representation.

 \label{zsae-overview}
\end{figure}

The second and more concrete contribution of this paper is
the proposal of Zero-Suppressed State AutoEncoder (ZSAE, \refig{zsae-overview}).
ZSAE obtains a more ``stable'' propositions and is less sensitive to hyperparameters.
In ZSAE, an additional penalty function
guides the network optimization so that unused propositions tend to 
take the value of zero (false) instead of random values.
The stable representation results in a higher success rate of classical planning.
Furthermore,
we show that we can prune some unused neurons
that have a constant activation of zero that was found by ZSAE.
This reduces the memory usage of the network.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
In \refsec{background}, we introduce Latplan \cite{Asai2018} and its SAE.
Next, we describe the problematic behavior of this vanilla SAE (as proposed in \cite{Asai2018}) and
a broader problem of \emph{Symbol Stability Problem} (\refsec{issues}).
We next analyze vanilla SAE to understand the source of stochasticity (\refsec{analysis}).
Next, we introduce Zero-Suppressed SAE (ZSAE), the main contribution of this paper (\refsec{zsae}).
We empirically evaluate the stability of the propositions generated by vanilla SAE and ZSAE,
as well as various other advantages of ZSAE (\refsec{evaluation}).
We finally conclude the paper with related work and future remark (\refsec{conclusion}).


\section{Preliminaries}
\label{background}

\textbf{Symbol Grounding} is an unsupervised process of establishing a mapping
from huge, noisy, continuous, unstructured inputs
to a set of compact, % clean
discrete, identifiable (structured) entities, i.e., symbols \cite{Asai2018}.
For example, PDDL has six kinds of symbols: Objects, predicates, propositions, actions, problems and domains.
Each type of symbol requires its own mechanism for grounding.
For example, the large body of work in the image processing community on recognizing 
objects (e.g. faces) and their attributes (male, female) in images, or scenes in videos (e.g. cooking)
can be viewed as corresponding to grounding the object, predicate and action symbols, respectively.
In this paper, we focus on the grounding process for propositional symbols.

\textbf{\latentplanner} \cite{Asai2018} is a framework for
\emph{domain-independent image-based classical planning}.
\latentplanner addresses two of the 6 types of symbols, % listed in \reftbl{tab:type-of-symbols},
namely propositional and action symbols.

Classical planners such as FF \cite{Hoffmann01} or
FastDownward \cite{Helmert04} takes a PDDL model as an input, which
specifies the state representation, the initial state, the goal
condition and the transition rules in the form of first order logic
formula.  In contrast, \latentplanner learns the state representation as well as the transition rules
entirely from the image-based observation of the environment with deep NNs.
% , and also claims to extend its capability on text/audio-based dialog data in the future.
The system was shown to solve various puzzle domains, such as 8-puzzles or Tower of Hanoi,
which are presented in a form of noisy, continuous visual depiction of the environment.

\begin{figure}[htb]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/planning.pdf}
 \caption{Classical planning in latent space:
It uses the learned State AutoEncoder (\refig{sae}) to convert pairs of images $(\before,\after)$ to symbolic transitions,
 from which the Action Model Acquisition (AMA) component generates an action model.
A classical planner finds the symbolic solution plan for symbolic initial/goal states encoded from images.
Finally, intermediate states in the plan are decoded back to a human-comprehensible image sequence.}
\label{fig:overview}
\end{figure}

\latentplanner (\refig{fig:overview}) takes two inputs.
The first input is the \emph{transition input} $Tr$, a set of pairs of raw data.
Each pair $tr_i=(\before_i, \after_i) \in Tr$ represents a transition of the environment before and after some action is executed.
The second input is the \emph{planning input} $(i, g)$, a pair of raw data, which corresponds to the initial and the goal state of the environment.
The output of \latentplanner is a data sequence representing the plan execution that reaches $g$ from $i$.
While the original paper uses an image-based implementation (``data'' = raw images),
the type of data is arbitrary as long as it is compatible to NNs.

% Emphasize the type of symbol, as readers are not familier with or haven't deeply thought about symbols
% \subsection{SAE for Propositional Symbol Grounding}

\latentplanner works in 3 phases.
In Phase 1, a \emph{State AutoEncoder} (SAE) (\refig{sae}) learns a bidirectional mapping between raw data (subsymbolic representation e.g., images)
 and propositional states (symbolic representation) from a set of unlabeled, random snapshots of the environment.
% The $Encode$ function maps images to propositional states, and $Decode$ function maps the propositional states back to images:
The trained SAE provides two functions:
\begin{itemize} %this is crucial to understanding the rest of the paper, so making an itemize to highlight it
\setlength{\itemsep}{-0.3em}
\item $b=Encode(r)$ maps an image  $r$ to a boolean vector $b$.
\item $\tilde{r}=Decode(b)$ maps a boolean vector $b$ to an image $\tilde{r}$.
\end{itemize}
After training the SAE from $\braces{\before_i, \after_i\ldots}$,
it applies $Encode$ to each $tr_i \in Tr$ and obtain $(Encode(\before_i),$ $Encode(\after_i))=$ $(s_i,t_i)=$ $\overline{tr}_i\in \overline{Tr}$,
the symbolic representations (latent space vectors) of the transitions.

In Phase 2, an Action Model Acquisition (AMA) method learns an action model (e.g. PDDL, successor function) from $\overline{Tr}$ in an unsupervised manner.
The original paper proposed two approaches: AMA$_1$ is an oracular model which directly generates a PDDL without learning,
by allowing it to use the whole set of valid transitions as an oracle.
In contrast, AMA$_2$ is an unsupervised machine learning model that can learn from limited examples.

In Phase 3, a planning problem instance is generated from the planning input $(i,g)$.
These are converted to symbolic states by the SAE, and the symbolic planner solves the problem.
For example, an 8-puzzle problem instance consists of an image of the start (scrambled) configuration of the puzzle ($i$), and an image of the solved state ($g$).

Since the intermediate states comprising the plan are SAE-generated latent bit vectors, the ``meaning'' of each state (and thus the plan) is not clear to a human observer.
However, in the final step, \latentplanner obtain a step-by-step visualization of the plan execution
by $Decode$'ing the latent bit vectors for each intermediate state.
This necessitates the bidirectionality of the mapping between the input and the propositional states.

\begin{figure}[htb]

 \caption{Step 1:
Train the State AutoEncoder by
 minimizing the sum of the reconstruction loss and the variational loss of Gumbel-Softmax.

Also, as the Gumbel-Softmax temperature $\tau$ decreases during training,
the latent values approach either 0 or 1.}

 % Variational AutoEncoder \cite{kingma2014semi} using Gumbel-Softmax \cite{jang2016categorical} reparametrization in its
 % latent layer.}
 \label{sae}
\end{figure}

\subsection{SAE as a Variational AutoEncoder using Gumbel-Softmax}

The key concept of the SAE in \latentplanner is the use of Gumbel-Softmax \cite{jang2016categorical}
reparameterization trick in the latent activation of Variational AutoEncoder.
This allows SAE to obtain the
discretized binary representation, and \latentplanner uses this
discrete vector as the state representation for classical planning.

An AutoEncoder (AE) is a type of feed-forward NNs that learns
an identity function whose output matches the input \cite{hinton2006reducing}.
AEs are trained by backpropagation (BP) to minimize the reconstruction loss,
the distance between the input and the output according to a distance function such as Euclidean distance.
Since it is trained solely by the raw input data, it is a unsupervised learning method that do not require the human-assigned labels.
Its intermediate layer (typically smaller than the input) has a compressed, \emph{latent representation} of the input.
% AEs are commonly used for pretraining a NN.
NNs, including AEs, typically have continuous activations and integrating them with propositional reasoners is not straightforward.

A Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) \cite{kingma2013auto} is a type of AE that forces the \emph{latent layer} (the most compressed layer in the AE) to follow a certain distribution (e.g., Gaussian).
% While initially proposed for enforcing Gaussian distributions, VAEs have been used to enforce arbitrary types of distribution (notably by Generative Adversarial Network \cite{goodfellow2014generative,makhzani2015adversarial}). 
Since the random distribution is not differentiable (BP is not applicable), VAEs use \emph{reparameterization tricks}, which decompose the target distribution into a differentiable and a purely random distribution (the latter does not require the gradient).
For example, the Gaussian $N(\sigma,\mu)$ is decomposed to $\mu+\sigma N(1,0)$, where $\mu,\sigma$ are learned.
In addition to the reconstruction loss, VAE should also minimize the variational loss (the difference between the learned and the target distributions) measured by, e.g.,  KL divergence.

Gumbel-Softmax (GS) is a reparametrization trick \cite{jang2016categorical} for categorical distribution.
It continuously approximates Gumbel-Max \cite{maddison2014sampling}, a method for drawing categorical samples.
Assume the output $z$ is a one-hot vector, e.g. if the domain is $D=\braces{a,b,c}$, $\brackets{0,1,0}$ represents ``b''.
The input is a class probability vector $\pi$, e.g. $\brackets{.1,.1,.8}$.
Gumbel-Max draws samples from $D$ following $\pi$:
% \[
 $z_i \equiv [ \text{if}\ i\ \text{is} \arg \max_i (g_i+\log \pi_i) \text{then}\ 1\ \text{else}\ 0 ]$
% \]
where $g_i$ are i.i.d samples drawn from Gumbel$(0,1)$ \cite{gumbel1954statistical}.
Gumbel distribution is a random distribution that can be sampled from $-\log (-\log (\text{Uniform}(0,1)))$, where
$\text{Uniform}(0,1)$ is a uniform random distribution between 0 and 1.
Gumbel-Softmax approximates argmax with softmax to make it differentiable:
% \[
$z_i = \text{Softmax}((g_i+\log \pi_i)/\tau)$.
% \]
``Temperature'' $\tau$ controls the magnitude of approximation, which is annealed to 0 by a certain schedule.
The output of GS converges to a discrete one-hot vector when $\tau\approx 0$.

In a vanilla SAE \cite{Asai2018}, there are $N$ units of Gumbel-Softmax
for $M=2$ categories in the latent layer, resulting in a $N\times 2$ matrix,
where $N$ specifies the number of propositional variables in the latent
state representation. The latent layer can be written as
$z_{ij}$ where $j\in \braces{0,1}$ and $1\leq i \leq N$.  When the
temperature $\tau$ is low, one of $z_{i0}$ or $z_{i1}$ takes the value
near 1 and another one takes the value near 0 (one-hot vector).  A binary
propositional vector $b$ can thus be extracted by taking the first row, i.e.,
$b=\parens{b_1\ldots b_N}=\parens{z_{10}\ldots z_{N0}}$.

\subsection{AMA$_1$, an Oracular Action Model Acquisition method}

Action Model Acquisition method AMA$_1$ produces a PDDL/SAS model compatible to
FastDownward \cite{Helmert04}, but is an oracular model which requires the entire state transitions
in the environment.
For each pair of observations $\parens{\before_i, \after_i}$ in the entire set of state transitions allowed in the environment,
AMA$_1$ uses SAE to encodes it into 
a symbolic transition $(Encode(\before_i),$ $Encode(\after_i))=$ $(s_i,t_i)$ where $s_i,t_i$ are propositional states.
Each state (either $s_i,t_i$) is represented as a binary vector $(b_j)_{1\leq j \leq N}$.
Each symbolic transition is then encoded into a PDDL action 
using $s_i$ as its preconditions and the difference of $s_i$ and $t_i$ as its effects.
Each bit $b_j$ is converted into zero-ary predicate \texttt{($b_j$-true)} and \texttt{($b_j$-false)}
when $b_j=1$ and $0$, respectively.
For instance, when $b_5$ is 0 in $s_i$ and 1 in $t_i$,
the preconditions include \texttt{(b5-false)} and
the effects include \texttt{(and (not (b5-false)) (b5-true))}.

\subsection{Regularization in Neural Networks}

\emph{Regularization} is an important and broad concept in machine learning
that limits the representation capacity of a machine learning model by adding a constraint
so that the model better adapt to the underlying characteristics of the dataset.
Regularization trades the (training) performance with generalization capability (testing performance, robustness to
unseen data points) in order to suppress overfitting.
Regularization could be implemented in various ways.

One way is to organize and restrain the network connection for the particular data,
such as Convolutional Networks for images
or Recurrent Networks for sequential data, or
Dropout \cite{srivastava2014dropout}, that randomly drops some neurons so
that each pattern is more strongly associated with a fewer set of nodes.

Another way is to add a penalty term to the optimization metric of the
NNs that is minimized by algorithms like Stochastic
Gradient Descent.
Common regularization techniques in this category include
$l_1$ (LASSO) or $l_2$ (ridge) regularization that respectively penalizes the absolute sum / square sum of the
activations.

% It is necessary for the mapping to be bidirectional, because the
% propositional variables are machine-generated symbols, and also the
% resulting plan (returned as a sequence of propositional states) should
% be decoded back to real-world images which are interpretable for humans.

% \latentplanner also learns the action model using a neural action model acquisition method AMA$_2$,
% but we omit the details due to space limitation.

\section{Symbol Stability Problem}
% \section{Issues in the State Representation\\ in the vanilla SAE}
\label{issues}

SAE in \latentplanner can map a visual observation of the environment to/from a set of propositional values.
An issue in a vanilla SAE is that the class probability that is used inside its Gumbel-Softmax could be
neutral for the class ``true'' and the class ``false'' at some neuron, and the resulting value
of a proposition is random (\refig{unstable}).
The randomness of the vanilla SAE comes from the way
Gumbel distribution is sampled, $-\log (-\log (\text{Uniform}(0,1)))$, which includes
a uniform random distribution.
This causes several problems from the classical planning point of view.

\begin{figure}[htb]
 \centering
 \includegraphics{img/unstable.pdf}
 \caption{Propositions found by vanilla SAE may contain several uninformative bits
 that flip randomly and do not affect the output.}
 \label{unstable}
\end{figure}

First, search algorithms that run on the state space generated based on these propositional vectors
are confused by many variations of the essentially identical real world states.
It could visit several variations of the same real world state that are encoded into different propositional vectors
while the duplicate detection in state space search algorithms (e.g. \astar) treat them as separate states.
% since it completely relies on the atomiticy and deteminisim of the proposition.
This slows down the search by increasing the number of nodes that are reachable from the initial state.

\begin{figure}[htb]
 \centering
 \includegraphics{img/disconnected.pdf}
 \caption{Random variations of propositional encoding for a single real-world state could disconnect the search space.}
 \label{disconnected}
\end{figure}

Secondly, the state space could be disconnected due to such random variations (\refig{disconnected}).
Some states may be reached only via a single variation of the real world state and is not connected to the
other variation of the propositional state that represents the same real-world state.
In fact, in the appendix section in the Arxiv version of the original paper \cite{Asai2018},
the authors stated that they used \emph{state augmentation} technique
which circumvents this problem by sampling states from the same image multiple times.

Thirdly, in order to reduce the stochasticity of the propositions, we encounter a hyperparameter tuning problem
which is costly when we train a large NN.
We note that while some propositions in the latent layer are random, most propositions are not.
These unused, uninformative bits are generated because the network has an excessive capacity to 
model the entire state space, i.e. they appear when we specify the number of proposition $N$ too large.
If we decrease $N$ while maintaining the reconstruction capability of the SAE, the number of uninformative bits
reduces.
On the contrary, if we specify $N$ too small, it lacks the capacity to represent the state space
and the SAE is no longer able to reconstruct the
real world image.
As a result, we face a hyperparameter tuning problem: Too large $N$ causes a disconnected/bloated state space graph,
and too small $N$ does not converge on the dataset.

% \section{Symbol Stability Problem}

As we have seen, unstable propositional representations are harmful to symbolic reasoning algorithms (search)
in various ways.
Fundamentally,
these harmful effects are caused by breaking a critical feature of symbols, \emph{designation} \cite{newell1976computer,newell1980physical},
that each symbol uniquely refers to an entity (referent, concept, meaning).
The referents of the symbols grounded by SAE are the truthfulness of the propositional statements.
If a meaning of a symbol changes frequently and in an unexpected manner, the entire symbolic manipulation is fruitless
because the underlying symbols are not grounded / tied to any particular concept, and does not represent the real world.

% [more intuitive example?]
% A famous 
% Colorless green ideas sleep furiously


Thus, a symbol grounding procedure should not only find \emph{some} set of symbols that is sufficient to represent the
environment but also find a \emph{stable} symbolic representation that uniquely describes the environment.
% This stability should be checked 

\begin{defi}
A \emph{symbolic representation} of an environment is a set of symbols with referents
from which a certain function can reconstruct the environment with sufficient accuracy.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}
A symbol in a symbolic representation of an environment is \emph{stable}
when its referent (e.g. truth assignment for propositional symbols) is identical
for the same observation of the environment that is represented.
\end{defi}

%% wanted to include, but not during the submission
% The meaning of ``the same observation'' depends on the context,
% and the acceptable divergence within the set of actual data for ``the same observations'' may be either low-level or high-level.
% Low-level divergence includes the noise in the images,
% while high-level divergence may include any task-specific inessential details.
% For example, in the visual depiction of a STRIPS Blocksworld,
% the actual locations of the stacks would be irrelevant to the task.

%% single example is not enough
% From a practical perspective, 
% the impact of unstable symbols on symbolic reasoning systems is typically exponential to the number of unstable symbols.
% For example, in the case of search algorithms, each unstable symbol doubles the size of the state space (being true or false).
% % In a hypothetical Prolog-like logic programming system, each unstable predicate symbol would also double the
% % number of unifications.

While NNs tend to achieve a robust performance on noisy data,
\textbf{the stability of the representation and the \emph{robust performance} are orthogonal.}
This is because the latter cares solely about the accuracy for the training/validation data,
while the former is a statement about the quality of the \emph{internal} activation values of the network
while maintaining the same accuracy.

% stability

The stability of the representation obtained by a NN depends
on
its inherent stochasticity during the runtime (as opposed to the training time) as well as
the stochasticity of the environment.
% 
These observations indicate that any symbol grounding systems potentially suffer from 
the symbol stability problem.
% 
As for the stochasticity of the environment,
in many real-world tasks, it is common to obtain stochastic observations
due to the external interference, e.g., vibrations of the camera caused by the wind.
% 
As for the stochasticity of the network,
in recent years
an increasing number of NNs relies on some form of random
sampling processes, including VAEs
\cite{kingma2013auto,jang2016categorical,higgins2016beta}
and Generative Adversarial Networks \cite[GAN]{goodfellow2014generative}.

\section{Analyzing State AutoEncoder}
\label{analysis}

To obtain a deeper understanding of the mechanism that generates
unstable symbols in vanilla SAEs, we
analyzed the source code of Latplan published on Github.
% 
Surprisingly, we found that they are using an incorrect loss function for Gumbel-Softmax VAE (GS-VAE),
and \emph{this very mistake} is essential to the success of their experiment
by \emph{largely suppressing the instability} of the symbols.

% % Keep in mind that the reviewers might be symbolic people -- so use the intuitive words as possible.
% The purpose of GS-VAE is to obtain a NN
% whose latent layer resembles a random categorical distribution
% with a certain number of categories $M$ ($M=2$ in Latplan).
 
Following Maddison et. al., (\citeyear[Appendix C.1]{MaddisonMT17}),
let $P_a(D=d)$ be a probability mass function where
$d$ is a $N$-dimensional one-hot vector of $M$ categories ($N\times M$ matrix),
$D$ follows a discrete random distribution $\text{Discrete}(a)$ and
$a$ is a \emph{fixed} matrix of probabilities ($a\in {[0,1]}^{N\times M}$)
that $d_{ij}$ becomes 1.
% 
In Latplan and other reference implementations \cite{ericjanggithub} of GS-VAE,
$a$ is assumed to be fair to any $j$,
i.e. $a$ is a matrix whose values are all $\frac{1}{M}$. (Note that $M=2$ in Latplan.)
The purpose of training a GS-VAE is to make the latent distribution $Q(D=Encode(x)\, |\, x)$ similar to $P_a(D)$.
% Note that this $Q$ assumes $Encode(x)$ is a categorical distribution $D$.
Note that, contrary to the assumption in Latplan,
$Q(D|x)$ is a conditional distribution defined for a \emph{fixed} input $x$,
thus it naturally assumes that the encoded result $Encode(x)$ is stochastic.

% Let $Z$ be the gumbel-softmax approximation of $D$ with some temperature.

To make $Q(D|x)$ similar to $P_a(D)$, the standard approach is to minimize $D_{\text{KL}}(Q||P_a)$,
the KL divergence of $Q$ from $P_a$.
In Latplan, it is approximated by $- \sum_{i,j} Q(z_{ij}=1|x) \log\frac{P_a(z_{ij}=1)}{Q(z_{ij}=1|x)}$.
% = \mathop{\mathbb{E}}_{D\sim Q(d|x)}\brackets{ \log \frac{P_a(D)}{Q(D|x)}}
\cite[A negated version of Eq.22, which is a maximization objective.]{MaddisonMT17}

This approximation is computed as follows.
Recall that Gumbel-Softmax is $z_{ij} = \text{Softmax}((g_{ij}+\log \pi_{ij})/\tau)$,
where $\log \pi_{ij}$ is an un-normalized logit and is an input to the layer,
from which the normalized probability can be computed as $q_{ij}=\text{Softmax}_j(\log \pi_{ij})$.
Also, $P_a(z_{ij}=1)= 1/M$.
% 
Therefore, the approximated KL divergence is
$-\sum_{i,j} q_{ij} \log \frac{1/M}{q_{ij}} = \sum_{i,j} q_{ij} \log q_{ij} + q_{ij} \log M = \sum_{i,j} q_{ij} \log q_{ij} + \text{Const}$,
where the constant can be ignored.
% The second term is a constant because $\sum_j q_{ij} = 1$,
% and thus can be safely ignored from the loss function.
% Therefore, the remaining term is $\sum_{i,j} q_{ij} \log q_{ij}$.

\subsection{Incorrect Loss Function Helped Latplan}

We found that the Latplan code published on Github is actually using the \emph{negation} of this loss,
i.e. it is \emph{maximizing} the KL divergence instead of minimizing it (as is expected in GS-VAE).
In fact, minimizing the KL divergence and finding a stable representation are opposite.
Consider the nature of GS-VAE:
It tries to make the distribution look more similar to a fair random categorical distribution $P_a(D)$
that takes 0 or 1 with equal probability, i.e., \emph{more random}.
This is clearly the opposite of the stable symbols we pursue.
Instead, \citeauthor{Asai2018} accidentally negated the loss, which resulted in
maximizing the KL divergence and making the representation \emph{less random}.

We further show that their \emph{negated} KL loss function
actually \emph{guarantees to reduce} the randomness,
instead of converging to any other random distribution different from $P_a(D)$.
This can be shown as follows:
\begin{align*} 
 \brackets{\text{rec loss}}-D_{\text{KL}}(Q||P_a)&                                         \\
=\brackets{\text{rec loss}}+D_{\text{KL}}(Q||P_a)&- 2 D_{\text{KL}}(Q||P_a)                \\
=\brackets{\text{\small correct GS VAE loss}}& + 2 \sum_{i,j} (- q_{ij} \log q_{ij})      \\
=\brackets{\text{\small correct GS VAE loss}}& + 2 \sum_{i} H(b_i)                        \\
\geq\brackets{\text{\small correct GS VAE loss}}& + 2 H(b_0,b_1\ldots b_N)
\end{align*}
where $H(b_i)$ denotes the \emph{shannon entropy} of individual proposition $b_i$ and
$H(b_0,b_1\ldots b_N)$ is the joint entropy of the propositions.
It shows that their loss function is an upper bound approximation of
the sum of the GS-VAE loss and the entropy (measure of randomness) of the representation.
The equality holds when all propositions $b_i$ are independent.
% 
In other words,
the \emph{incorrect GS-VAE loss function}
was indeed a modification of GS-VAE with an additional \emph{entropy-based regularization},
which penalizes the network for learning an unstable representation
through a loss function and restricts the network to learn a stabler representation.

In the later sections, we empirically show that the \emph{correct} GS-VAE results in
a much higher randomness for a single input compared to the original code of Latplan,
thus the original implementation, i.e., GS-VAE + Entropy regularization, is superior.
% 
\emph{It is not our intention to criticize Latplan for its ``incorrect VAE loss'',
nor the validity of their claims.
Out claim is that their loss implementation is the key to achieving the desired behavior.}
% In fact, there is no reason that the loss should be identical to the GS-VAE loss.

\subsection{Stochasticity during Run-Time}

Another observation we made from the source code is that we can
disable the runtime stochasticity of the network.
After the training is finished, we replace the gumbel-softmax activation with
a pure argmax,
$z_{ij} = [ \text{if}\ j\ \text{is} \arg \max_j (\log \pi_{ij})\ \text{then}\ 1\ \text{else}\ 0 ]$.
This improves the stability of the symbols, as we later show in the experiments.

Above two techniques do not reduce the stochasticity originated from the noisy input,
but only to the inherent stochasticity of the network.
Recall that $Q(D|x)$ is a conditional distribution defined for a single, \emph{fixed} input $x$.
% 
For instance, the propositional representation may be altered by a small
Gaussian noise applied to the input.

% \section{Zero-Suppressed State AutoEncoder (ZSAE) and Entropy-Minimizing State AutoEncoder (ESAE)}
\section{Zero-Suppressed State AutoEncoder}
\label{zsae}

% As we have shown in the previous section, vanilla SAE is a GS-VAE with
% entropy-based regularization, and also we can remove the runtime
% stochasticity of the network by replacing the activation function.
% However, these techniques do not eliminate the stochasticity originated from the
% noisy input.  Noisy variations of the same image, generated by adding a
% Gaussian noise to the same image, may result in a different
% propositional representation.

To further tackle the symbol stability problem in Latplan,
we need to reduce the effect of the external stochasticity of the environment
to the latent, propositional representation, while preserving the reconstruction accuracy
 (\emph{robust performance}).
We address it by Zero-Suppressed State AutoEncoder (ZSAE),
a SAE with an additional regularization.

Its basic idea is to penalize the
true propositions in the latent layer so that no propositions unnecessarily flip to true at random,
while preserving the propositions that are absolutely necessary for maintaining the reconstruction accuracy.
% Since Gumbel-Softmax (GS) is basically a Softmax function,
% and SAE uses 2 categories,
% This can be seen as adding an
% asymmetric penalty for a particular class label (true) used in the encoding.
% 
The resulting loss function below is similar to the $l_1$ norm (LASSO) typically
applied to continuous activations:

\begin{align*}
 \brackets{\text{loss}} = & \brackets{\text{\small vanilla SAE loss}} + \brackets{\text{\small 0-Sup. loss}} \\ 
 =                        & \brackets{\text{\small vanilla SAE loss}} + \alpha\cdot\text{mean}(b)
\end{align*}
$\alpha$ is a hyperparameter which specifies the magnitude of the zero-suppression.
% Similar to $l_1$ regularization, this achieves a sparser representation in the binary domain where
%  more propositions take the value of 0 (\refig{zsae-overview}).
% 
This alters the $P_a(D)$, the target distribution of GS-VAE.
Recall that, in GS-VAE, $P_a(z_{ij}=1)=q_i\frac{1}{M}$, i.e. the probability for $z_ij$ to turn to 1 is fair to any $j$.
Since zero-suppression penalizes the true bits ($z_{i0}=1$), it changes this fairness: The larger the $\alpha$,
the less $P_a(z_{i0}=1)$,
thus the more propositions take the value of 0 (\refig{zsae-overview}).
% This changes the target distribution of the KL-divergence.

One additional advantage of ZSAE is that
several neurons are completely deactivated, i.e. always takes the value of zero
and can be pruned afterward to reduce the network size.
% 
A possible interpretation of this approach from the symbolic perspective is that
this regularization is working as a prior corresponding to \emph{closed-world assumption} \cite[CWA]{reiter1981closed}.
CWA assumes that all propositions are \texttt{false}
when they are unknown to a Knowledge Base (KB) or cannot be proven from it (negation as failure).
% % [wrong!]
% % We could interpret these unknown propositions defaulted to be false as those which are irrelevant
% % to the current task that the agent is solving.
% Being always false, the agent can safely ignore them because
% they do not trigger an additional set of rules by satisfying their preconditions.
% Also, the KB no longer has to explicitly store the false propositions.
With CWA, KBs no longer have to explicitly store the false propositions,
similar to the ZSAE which can prune the constant-0 nodes.
% 
% Similarly, in ZSAE, we could conceive that there is an infinite number of neurons
% that are already pruned from the network and are just invisible.
In other words,
% combining the discrete representation and zero-suppression,
ZSAE embeds CWA as a model prior.


\section{Empirical Evaluation}
\label{evaluation}

We evaluated various SAE implementations across 5 different
image domains depicting 8-puzzles or Lights Out puzzle game \cite{lightsout}.
Experiments were performed on a compute cluster with Xeon Ivy Bridge
processors and Tesla K40 GPUs.  Each training takes at most 30 minutes.
Network details are in the supplement.

\textbf{MNIST 8-puzzle}
is an image-based version of the 8-puzzle, where tiles contain hand-written digits (0-9) from the  MNIST database \cite{lecun1998gradient}.
Valid moves in this domain swap the ``0'' tile  with a neighboring tile, i.e., the ``0'' serves as the ``blank'' tile in the classic 8-puzzle. 
The \textbf{Scrambled Photograph 8-puzzle (Mandrill, Spider)} cuts and scrambles real photographs, similar to the puzzles sold in stores).
These differ from the MNIST 8-puzzle in that ``tiles'' are \textit{not} cleanly separated by black regions
(we re-emphasize that \latentplanner has no built-in notion of square or movable region).
% In \textbf{Towers of Hanoi (ToH)},
% we generated the 4 disks instances.
% 4-disk ToH resulted in a 15-step optimal plan.
\textbf{LightsOut} is
a video game where a grid of lights is in some on/off configuration ($+$: On),
and pressing a light toggles its state as well as the states of its neighbors.
The goal is all lights Off.
Unlike previous puzzles, a single operator can flip 5/16 locations at once and
removes some ``objects'' (lights).
This demonstrates that \latentplanner is not limited to domains with highly local effects and static objects.
\textbf{Twisted LightsOut} distorts the original LightsOut game image by a swirl effect, 
showing that \latentplanner is not limited to handling rectangular ``objects''/regions.

% There are three versions of 8-puzzles (MNIST, Mandrill, Spider).
% MNIST 8-puzzle is an image-based versions of the 8-puzzle, where tiles contain
% hand-written digits (0-9) from the MNIST database
% \cite{lecun1998gradient}. Each digit is shrunk to 14x14 pixels, so each
% state of the puzzle is a 42x42 image.  Valid moves in this domain swap
% the ``0'' tile with a neighboring tile, i.e., the ``0'' serves as the
% ``blank'' tile in the classic 8-puzzle.  The entire state space consists
% of 362880 states ($9!$) and 967680 actions.  From any specific goal state, the reachable
% number of states is 181440 ($9!/2$).  Note that the same image is used
% for each digit in all states, e.g., the tile for the ``1'' digit is the
% same image in all states.
% 
% Mandrill and Spider are 8-puzzles generated by cutting and scrambling real photographs
% (similar to sliding tile puzzle toys sold in stores). We used the
% ``Mandrill'' and ``Spider'' images, two of the standard benchmark in the image processing
% literature.  The image was first converted to greyscale and then
% % rounded to black/white (0/1) values
% histogram-normalization and contrast enhancement was applied.
% The same number of transitions as in the MNIST-8puzzle experiments are used.
% 
% 
% Lights Out is a puzzle game where a grid of lights is in some on/off configuration ($+$: On),
% and pressing a light toggles its state (On/Off) as well as the state of all of its neighbors.
% The goal is all lights Off.
% The image dimension is 36x36 and the size of each button ($+$ button) is 9x9.
% 4x4 LightsOut has $2^{16}=65536$ states and $16\times 2^{16}=1048576$ transitions.
% Similar to the 8-puzzle instances, we used 20000 transitions.
% Training:validation ratio 9:1 is maintained (i.e. only 36000 images and 18000 transitions are used for training).
% 
% Another version of Lights Out game is Twisted LightsOut.
% While the images have the same structure as LightsOut, 
% we additionally applied a swirl effect available in scikit-image package
% in order to remove the grid-like structure in the images.
% The effect is applied to the center, with strength=3, linear interpolation, 
% and radius equal to 0.75 times the dimension of the image.

% unnecessary?
% Training is performed on 150 epochs, with an annealing schedule
% $\tau=5e^{- (\log\frac{5}{0.7})\frac{t}{150}}\in [0.7,5]$.
% On all configurations, $\alpha$ is initially set to 0 during the first 50 epochs until set to the specified value.
% This is in order to make the network sufficiently trained to
% reconstruct the environment before trying to stabilize the propositions.
% Further details are in the supplement.

\subsection{State Variance}

We test the effectiveness of our modifications to the system in terms of variance reduction of the state encoding.
We trained several SAEs for each domain with $N=100,1000$ and then evaluated the variance.
In all experiments below,
we randomly generated 100 images with a domain-specific generator for each puzzle domain,
then encoded each of them with the SAE 100 times.
We measured the variance of the propositions, i.e. the variance of latent activations (0 or 1)
across 100 encoding trials of the same image.
We then took the maximum and the mean of the variances over the entire propositions.

We evaluated three versions of the SAE:
(1) NG-SAE, an SAE trained with a correct GS-VAE loss function as discussed in \refsec{analysis}, and
(2) Vanilla SAE, as described in the original paper of Latplan \cite{Asai2018} and the Github source code,
(3) Zero-Suppressed SAE (ZSAE).

The first thing we tested is to replace the gumbel-softmax function with a deterministic argmax function
after the training.
In all SAEs,
this reduced the variance to 0 because it makes the network deterministic for a single input.
The result is rather obvious, therefore we omit it due to space (see supplement).
In the following experiments, we always replace the activation function with argmax.

We next measured the variance of SAEs in a noisy setting, where
we applied a new Gaussian noise to the image each time before we encode it.
\reftbl{tab:stability} (first columns) indicates that
the propositions made by NG-SAE are highly random,
while additional entropy regularization in vanilla SAE suppresses the stochastic behavior
and achieves a stabler propositional representation.
ZSAE further reduces the variance, as seen by the \emph{maximum} variance across propositions approaching zero,
which indicates that the noisy observations of a single real world state maps to exactly one propositional state.

 }
\label{tab:stability}
\end{table*}

We next measured the average percentage of propositions that turned true.
\reftbl{tab:stability} (middle columns) shows that the ratio significantly drops due to the Zero-suppression penalty,
demonstrating that $P_a(D)$ is altered by the regularization.

Finally, \reftbl{tab:stability} (right columns) shows that the number of effective bits,
i.e. the number of propositions that \emph{ever} change their values, is low in ZSAE, showing that
ZSAE obtained a more compressed, compact representation of the input.
In MNIST, the numbers are comparable between ZSAEs with $(N,\alpha)=100$ and $1000$.
This shows that the network is able to find an encoding of almost the same size
regardless of the size of the latent layer (upper bound of the size of
propositions), removing the need for hyperparameter tuning.
In LightsOut and Twisted, ZSAE even finds the 16bit representation for the 4x4 light grids,
i.e. the optimally compressed representation.
The additional
penalty encourages the network to find the more compact representation,
rather than freely consuming the latent space capacity in an entangled representation.

% Furthermore, while regularization in general tends to trade accuracy and
% the desired characteristics in the activation, we observe that the
% reconstruction loss is still low if you maintain the latent space size
% large enough.

\subsection{Planner Performance}

Next we compared the success ratio of \latentplanner using Z/SAE with various parameters.
We tested both Action Model Acquisition (AMA) methods AMA$_1$ and AMA$_2$ proposed in \cite{Asai2018}.

Each domain has 60 problem instances each generated by a random walk from
the goal state. 60 instances consist of 30 instances each generated by a 7-steps random walk
and another 30 by 14 steps. 30 instances consist of 10 instances whose images are corrupted by Gaussian noise,
10 with salt/pepper noise and another 10 with no noise.

We first tested AMA$_1$, an oracular, idealistic AMA that does not incorporate machine learning,
and instead generates the entire propositional state transitions from the entire image transitions.
The purpose we test an impractical AMA$_1$ method is
to separate the effect of a better state representation achieved by ZSAE
and that of the learning procedure in AMA$_2$ that learns the state transitions and the action rules.
As a classical planner, we used FastDownward \cite{Helmert04} with blind heuristics in order to
remove the effects of the heuristic functions.

The results in \reftbl{tab:ama1} shows that ZSAE achieves the overall improvement in terms of success rate.
ZSAE is more robust against the different sizes of the latent space.
Moreover, the variance of the number of solved instances is quite high in SAE.
% 
Further analyses showed that
in X models (out of 10 trials), the planner always fails to find a solution because
the state space graph was completely disconnected.
% 
Even if we remove those pathological cases of SAE (third column), its average success is still
lower than ZSAE.

\label{tab:ama1}
\end{table}

Another harmful effect of the unstable propositions is
their effect on the duplicate detection mechanism of search algorithms.
To demonstrate that this effect is also reduced by ZSAE,
we measured the number of node generations
on the models resulted from vanilla SAE and ZSAE and successfully solved by
the planner (\refig{fig:ama1-visited}).
% ???
% Since the planner uses a blind search and the problem is unit-cost, all nodes under the solution depth are generated
% (note: mind the difference between evaluation, expansion, generation).
The plot supports our claim that
the randomness in the state encoding of vanilla SAE confuses the duplicate detection and
generates larger number of states compared to ZSAE.

for the search space obtained from SAE and ZSAE with $N=64,100$ (all domains).

 % 
We observe that planning under SAE-generated search space could generate x100 more states
than under ZSAE-generated search space, while the opposite happens only up to x5 more states.
The latter case happens due to the difference in the tiebreaking orders and also because some nodes randomly become unreachable (disconnected) in SAE.
$N=36$ is not shown because
it is a parameter tuned for SAE to have stable propositions, thus the comparison does not make sense.

% Next, we show the performance when AMA$_2$ is used
% (\reftbl{tab:ama2}). Networks in AMA$_2$ (AAE/AD/SD) are trained with the same hyperparameter

\subsection{Pruning Inactive Nodes from ZSAE}

% [too obvious and intuitive?]

We compute the amount of memory reduction possible by the pruning on the nodes
that has a constant activation of 0. As we saw from \reftbl{tab:stability},
vanilla SAE does not have such propositions (all bits are effective bits).
% While we did not actually implemented the node pruning,

First, since our network has a fully-connected network between the
latent layer and the convolutional layer before it, node reduction
amounts to linear weight reduction.  Representing a fully-connected
network between two layers of $L$ and $N$ nodes requires $(L+1)N$
weights ($+1$ for the bias).
In the network we used, $L=1000$. Thus, in the case of ZSAE with $\alpha=0.7, N=1000$
where it reduces the representation down to only 46 effective bits, weights are reduced by 954954,
which is huge compared to the convolutional weights (3x3, 16 channels, thus 144 float values).
This also applies to the decoding layers.
We do not show the entire results due to space limitation and also because the results are straightforward.

% [wrong! convolutions are more expensive]
% Second, we considered the inference time by the number of multiplication operations and also by the actual test.
% First, the operations: In the same example above,
% matrix multiplication $y=Wx+b$ (where $W$ is the weights and $b$ the bias) requires $LN$ multiplication and $L+N$ additions.
% Moreover, the Gumbel-Softmax operation requires $N$ softmax calculations, gumbel sampling (two logarithms) and one float division.
% This overall amounts to a linear speed up along the reduction of $N$, 
% since the cost of addition is negligible to the cost of multiplication.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

We introduced Zero-Suppressed State AutoEncoder (ZSAE) which addresses
the issue of \emph{unstable propositions} in the state encoding made by
\latentplanner.
% 
The ZSAE improves upon the
vanilla State AutoEncoder \cite[SAE]{Asai2018} by
adding an additional penalty to the optimization metric of
the NN, which tries to minimize the number of true propositions
when encoding a raw state input such as images.
% 
ZSAE improves the success rate and the efficiency of planning performed on
the generated state space, and also removes the need for aggressive
hyperparameter tuning.
% 
Moreover, 
ZSAE finds several neurons whose activations are constantly zero
and can be safely pruned.
% similar to Zero-Suppressed Decision Diagram \cite{minato1993zero}.

As a philosophical contribution,
we reframed the problematic behavior of unstable propositions
as \emph{Symbol Stability Problem} (SSP), a subproblem of Symbol Grounding Problem (SGP).
SSP applies to any processes that solve SGP.
% 
We identified two sources of the stochasticity which introduces unstable propositions,
the external stochasticity in the observations and the inherent stochasticity of the network.
There is an increasing use of sampling-based, stochastic processes in
the machine learning literature, notably VAEs and GANs,
which will be highly affected by SSP.

% ?
An interesting avenue for future work is to 
find an online, adaptive tuning method for $\alpha$, the hyperparameter for
zero-suppression regularization.
