* too much ``''s make the sentence look scattered and visually less recognizable. ``e.g.'' also.

* \em, \bf, \it are all obsolete \TeX primitives, and it does not take effect properly --- for example, {\bf {\it aaa}} shows ``aaa'' in italic but NOT IN BOLD. Use \emph{}, \textit{}, \textbf{} and so on.

* always use \ff, \fd, \cea, \pr, \mv , and do not use it directly, e.g. FF, FD/LAMA2011, etc. 

* use of footnotes should be minimized.

* IPC2011 should always be \ipc . The definition can later be modified in abbrev.sty .

* prefer separated words over hyphened words. domain
  independent>domain-independent, planner independent >
  planner-independent.

* Table, Figure, Fig., should not be used directly. Always use \refig and \reftbl. When the development flag is enabled, direct use of \ref signals an error.

* Caption ends with a period.
